import SwiftUI
//I have not touched this page yet, Going to add achievements for Total hour milestones(1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 1 Week, etc. Add achievements for specific sounds used, like joke sounds. Maybe achievements for time without taking break. And then Personal Records, longest session, most studious week, etc.
    //that should be enough for an achievement page, I believe i will use progress bars, to show progression, also the layout design will be alot more simple, maybe the color of the arcade machine with a thick outline of the blue, they should all be uniform
struct AchievementsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Achievements")
    }
}

#Preview {
    AchievementsView()
}
