Project 3
Build an IOS app using xcode

Design object for the project was settled on a Study Timer application.

Ideas for the application are as follows:
1) Build a study timer that tracks what subject and time allotted, currently set to 25 minutes
2) Introduce a reward/award system that benefits the user for studying i.e Study 20 minutes get a 5 minute break, badges that encourage study habits, etc
3) Design a theme for the gamification of the study app, current thought is a retro style arcade theme with nostalgia baiting color schemes and themes.
4) Add animations, sounds, and custom fonts to add further polish to the app.
